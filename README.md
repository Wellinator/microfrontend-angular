# What is this?

This project is and Angular 13 base project for implementing microfrontend with [@angular-architects/module-federation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-architects/module-federation) v14.2.0. Feel free to fork and get to know how it works!
I intend to add some documentation in the future for my own code base archive.
